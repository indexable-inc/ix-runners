# One GitHub Actions runner, one job, one ix VM.
#
# MECHANISM ONLY, maintained by ix. Repo policy - toolchain packages, job
# env - lives in the customer's importing config. The ix-platform
# workarounds below each carry a short why and an issue link on this
# repository; workaround code is deleted centrally as platform fixes land,
# and customers pick that up as a rev bump of their flake input.
#
# Design: the machine exists for exactly one job. The reconcile (this
# repository's action) creates it - restored from its lineage's seed
# snapshot, or cold from this very configuration - and writes a single-job
# JIT runner credential to /var/lib/ix-runner/jitconfig. The path unit below
# is watching; the service consumes the file (a spent credential must never
# ride into a seed snapshot), runs the one job, and exits. The reconcile
# then deletes the machine, or snapshots it first when the job was a green
# default-branch run - which is how the NEXT machine of this lineage boots
# with this one's warm HOME already in place.
#
# There is deliberately no registration token, no slot, no repair path and
# no co-tenant isolation here: one job per machine makes the machine
# boundary the isolation, and anything unhealthy is deleted, not healed.
